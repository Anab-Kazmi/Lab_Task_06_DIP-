# 2023-SE-06_Lab_Task_06_DIP-

Prompt:

Write a complete Python program using NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib, fully compatible with Google Colab, to demonstrate Frequency Domain Filtering in Digital Image Processing.
The program should perform the following tasks step by step:
Allow the user to upload two grayscale images using Google Colab.
Display both original images clearly.
Apply 2D Fourier Transform (FFT) to each image and shift the zero frequency component to the center.
Design a Low-Pass Filter mask and a High-Pass Filter mask in the frequency domain.
Apply the low-pass and high-pass filters separately to each image in the frequency domain.
Perform Inverse Fourier Transform (IFFT) to obtain:
Low-frequency images
High-frequency images
Display the results in a well-organized comparison layout, showing low-frequency and high-frequency components for both images.
Include a short analysis section explaining the difference between low-frequency and high-frequency components and their significance.
Ensure the code is clean, well-commented, logically structured, error-free, and suitable for direct lab submission.
